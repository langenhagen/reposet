# Contains a list of git repository information for repos that may be worked with together.
#
# Contains a bash-array named 'repos' of git repo paths and their local default branches, their
# default remotes and remote default branches for fetching and pushing, respectively.
# Each field is divided by the delimiter ':'.
#
# The format is as follows:
# <path>:<local-branch>:<remote-pull-repo>:<remote-pull-branch>:<remote-push-repo>:<remote-push-branch>
#
# Fields for remotes and branches can be empty. In such cases, reposet will not pull or push the
# according repos.
#
# Reposet does not consider submodules. Add submodules as normal repos to the reposets in order to
# update them.
